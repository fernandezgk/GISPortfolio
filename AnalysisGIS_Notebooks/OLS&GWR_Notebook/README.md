The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) results table above shows the different variables used in this model and their relationship to the prediction of the 2016 Presidential Electionâ€™s results. The variable, Gop_2008_Prc, is the percentage of republican votes for the 2008 Presidential Election. With a positive coefficient of 1.856718 and a probability value of 0, this variable is statistically significant for this model. As the percentage of republican votes increase, the probability the county votes republican again increases as well. The variable, Transnumenem, is the natural log of the number of unemployed individuals. It holds a coefficient of 0.551819, and a probability value of 0.229411, meaning although as the number of unemployed individuals increase, it is less likely to predict that Trump would win in the 2016 Presidential Election. So, this variable is not statistically significant for this model. The third variable, Transsomecol, is the natural log of the population of individuals in each county who has some college education. With a negative coefficient of -4.399343, and a probability value of 0, this variable is statistically significant for this model. When the number of individuals who have some college education increases, the probability Trump would win in those counties decreases. The overall R2 value for this model is 0.849814.
