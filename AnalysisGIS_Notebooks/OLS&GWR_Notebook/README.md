The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) results table above shows the different variables used in this model and their relationship to the prediction of the 2016 Presidential Election’s results. The variable, Gop_2008_Prc, is the percentage of republican votes for the 2008 Presidential Election. With a positive coefficient of 1.856718 and a probability value of 0, this variable is statistically significant for this model. As the percentage of republican votes increase, the probability the county votes republican again increases as well. The variable, Transnumenem, is the natural log of the number of unemployed individuals. It holds a coefficient of 0.551819, and a probability value of 0.229411, meaning although as the number of unemployed individuals increase, it is less likely to predict that Trump would win in the 2016 Presidential Election. So, this variable is not statistically significant for this model. The third variable, Transsomecol, is the natural log of the population of individuals in each county who has some college education. With a negative coefficient of -4.399343, and a probability value of 0, this variable is statistically significant for this model. When the number of individuals who have some college education increases, the probability Trump would win in those counties decreases. The overall R2 value for this model is 0.849814.

When looking at the results table below from our most previous assignment, Notebook 6, where we created OLS results tables in JupyterNotebooks, we can see some similarities. The variable x0 is the same as Gop_2008_Prc, x1 is the same as Transnumenem, and x2 is the same as Transsomecol. Variable x0’s coefficient is similar to how it is in the results from ArcPro (1.856718 ) with it being 1.1153 from the python model. A ~0.7 difference is not huge but still notable. The probability value for this variable is still 0, meaning it is statistically significant for the model. Variable x1’s coefficient is more similar to Transsomecol’s coefficient in the ArcPro model (-4.399343) than its own variable (0.551819) with it being -4.0282, however, the probability value is 0 for this model’s results while in the table above it is 0.229411. Variable x2’s coefficient is less, if you took the absolute value, than it is in the above table (-4.399343) with it being -2.4521. This variable also has a probability value of 0.006 making it still statistically significant for this model. The R2 value for this model is 0.863, slightly larger than the R2 value above.

The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) map above is a linear regression model to predict the 2016 Presidential Election results by determining its relationship with the gop_2008_percent, natural log transformation of the Unemployment_#_Unemployed, and the log transformation of Some_college_Population variables. As you can see above, the Northern Mid-West are counties where Trump is more likely to win their vote. The model also depicts that the counties in the lower coastline of the United States, including: a majority of Utah, the Alabama/Mississippi area, some of Southern California, and a bit of the Northern parts of the Pacific North-West counties are all counties where Trump is least likely to win their vote. The counties represented in the yellow or neutral color are counties where the model accurately predicted the outcome of the election.

In the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) map below, it factors in the local and regional variation for the model. This model does not include the variable Transsomecol due to it causing a Collinearity error. The map’s R2 value is 0.9745, causing the initial R2 value in ArcPro (0.849814) and from Notebook 6 (0.863) to increase more than 0.10. When compared to the OLS map above, it has slight similarities, however the colorization, or classification for the GWR map is more randomized than the OLS. The OLS map has more distinctive color patterns throughout the country as does the GWR map, but more in the Western areas, while Central and Eastern United States is almost like pixels.

In the GWR map below, I discovered that when running the tool in ArcPro, if I changed the Additional Options, Local Weighting Scheme from the originally set Bisquare, to Gaussian, it allows all variables to be used. The R2 value for this model is 0.9555 causing it to decrease in comparison to the other GWR model above. In regards to appearance, both maps do not differ all too much, however, there are more dark colored counties in Nevada and in Montana/Wyoming area in the model below that includes the some college population. I thought this was interesting because Gaussian is continuous, and we used it in the OLS models.
