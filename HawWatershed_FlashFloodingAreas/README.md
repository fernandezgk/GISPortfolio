## Introduction
In 2016, Hurricane Matthew tore through the Southern United States, including Virginia, Georgia, North and South Carolina. Specifically, Haw Watershed in North Carolina is at risk of flash flooding should another hurricane blow by. This flash flood model of Hurricane Matthew shows that the Haw Watershed is adversely affected by its urban cityscape, particular steep terrain and varied elevation, fine grained soil, and increased precipitation. All of these factors in addition to rain accumulation leads to a risk of flash flooding.
## Study Area 
Haw Watershed is located in the piedmont province in the north-central part of North Carolina, and is comprised of nine counties: Alamance County, Caswell County, Chatham County, Forsyth County, Guilford County, Orange County, Randolph County, Rockingham County, and Wake County. Figure 1 on the following page shows the outline of Haw Watershed, with the major roads and urban areas, along with lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers. The information depicted below will be helpful when comparing the different leveled flood risk areas further into our analysis. This watershed has varying elevation as shown in Figure 5, where the north-western areas appear to have higher elevation when compared to the eastern-central areas.
