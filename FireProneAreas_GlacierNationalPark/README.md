# Description:
In this lab, I created six maps depicting different factors that would help determine fire hazard areas in Glacier National Park. The factors are: High Standing Biomass, Forest Fuel Loads, Slope Degrees, Wind Levels, Fire Prone Distance from Trails, and Plant Moisture Levels. A composite heat map was created with all of the factors and the fire prone areas in Glacier National Park.
