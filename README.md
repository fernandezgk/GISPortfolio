## About Me
My name is Grace Fernandez, and I am a Senior at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). I am majoring in Political Science - National Security, and minoring in Geographic Information Sciences (GIS). I am from Leesburg, Virginia, and am looking for a full-time Geospatial Analyst or similar position in the Northern Virginia & Washington D.C. area. View my resume [here](Fernandez_Resume2020.pdf).

In a past course, I was able to determine Fire Prone Areas in Glacier National Park by analyzing several factors. In the heatmap below, you are able to see the areas that are very prone to fires. You can access the full report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/FireProneAreas_GlacierNationalPark).

I was also able to analyze Campbell County, Virginia to determine the best location for a new recreational facility. For this lab, each student was able to analyze a county of their choice for this project. Through analyzing several factors described in the report, you can see the recommended site for the facility below and can access the full report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/CampbellCounty_NewRecreationalFacility).

In another lab, I was able to analyze the Haw Watershed located in North Carolina, and it's susceptibility to Flash Flooding particularly during Hurricane Matthew in 2016. In the map below you are able to see the areas and their susceptibility to flooding, and you can access the full report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/HawWatershed_FlashFloodingAreas).
