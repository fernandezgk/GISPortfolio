My name is Grace Fernandez, and I am a Senior at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). I am majoring in Political Science - National Security, and pursuing a minor in Geographic Information Sciences (GIS). I am from Leesburg, Virginia, and I am looking for a full-time Geospatial Analyst or similar position upon graduation in May 2021 in the Northern Virginia & Washington D.C. area. In my free time I enjoy exploring Blacksburg, running, and learning more about GIS through the online training seminars offered by Esri. A folder of the completed training certificates can be accessed[here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/blob/main/Esri_Training/README.md).

Please feel free to view my resume [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/blob/main/miscellaneous/Fernandez_ResumeLI.pdf).

This semester, I am taking a course called Analysis in GIS where I am strengthening my understanding of the theory and application of GIS. The class provides emphasis on analytical operations, database design, cartographic modeling, and raster GIS. I am learning more about spatial data handling and analysis to facilitate decision-making through the communication of geographically referenced data. 

A project in Analysis in GIS required us to source data from the internet to demonstrate our understanding and skills with Pandas and Geopandas in JupyterNotebooks. Some of the skills we had to demonstrate were: calculating a field; taking a CSV that includes latitude and longitude, and turning it into a GeoDataFrame; joining data with geopandas; applying a buffer in geopandas; and projecting data from one CRS to another. You can access that notebook [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/blob/main/AnalysisGIS_Notebooks/FernandezNotebook5.ipynb). 

Another assignment in Analysis in GIS required us to analyze election data in such way that it complimented Bishop's claims in his book, The Big Sort. Although the book only discusses events up until 2004, we compared data from Dave Leip, the FEC, Tony McGovern, and Timothy Renner. We then calculated the percentage of counties for the years 2008, 2012, and 2016 that fall into Bishop's definitions for "competitive" and "landside" counties. Using Matplotlib, we create, and saved a single graph indicating the trends. Finally, we used the GPKG, and constructed two maps in either ArcPro or using GeoPandas that highlighted where only the landslide counties were in 2008 and 2016.

 In a past course, I was able to determine Fire Prone Areas in Glacier National Park by analyzing several factors. In the heatmap below, you are able to see the areas that are very prone to fires. You can access the full report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/FireProneAreas_GlacierNationalPark).

I was also able to analyze Campbell County, Virginia to determine the best location for a new recreational facility. For this lab, each student was able to analyze a county of their choice for this project. The data used for this project was collected from the Geospatial Data Gateway website, the  Census Data website, The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) website and The Campbell County GIS website. Through analyzing several factors described in the report, you can see the recommended site for the facility below and can access the full report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/CampbellCounty_NewRecreationalFacility).

In another lab, I was able to analyze the Haw Watershed located in North Carolina, and it's susceptibility to Flash Flooding particularly during Hurricane Matthew in 2016. I collected the Populated Areas, Urban Areas, and Roadways data for each county in the Haw Watershed from the Geospatial Data Gateway website. In the map below you are able to see the areas and their susceptibility to flooding, and you can access the full report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/HawWatershed_FlashFloodingAreas).
