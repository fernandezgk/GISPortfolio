## About Me
My name is Grace Fernandez, and I am a Senior at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). I am majoring in Political Science - National Security, and minoring in Geographic Information Sciences (GIS). I am from Leesburg, Virginia, and am looking for a full-time Geospatial Analyst or similar position in the Northern Virginia & Washington D.C. area. View my resume [here](Fernandez_Resume2020.pdf).

In a past course, I was able to determine Fire Prone Areas in Glacier National Park by analyzing several factors. You can access the report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/FireProneAreas_GlacierNationalPark). I was also able to analyze Campbell County, Virginia to determine the best location for a new recreational facility, each student was able to analyze a county of their choice for this project. Through analyzing several factors you can see the recommended site for the facility [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/CampbellCounty_NewRecreationalFacility). In another lab, I was able to analyze the Haw Watershed located in North Carolina, and it's susceptibility to Flash Flooding, you can access the report [here](https://github.com/fernandezgk/GISPortfolio/tree/main/HawWatershed_FlashFloodingAreas).
